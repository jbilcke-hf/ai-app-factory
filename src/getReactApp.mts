You need to write the list of files for a new NextJS 12 application.
The app is about: ${prompt}.
Think step by step, you got this!
Please write, file by file, the source code for a Next 12 application.
The app should be buildable when we run this in command line:
\`\`\`
npm install
npm run start
\`\`\`

The project will be deployed to Hugging Face, so it must include a README.md with the following YAML header:
\`\`\`
---
license: apache-2.0
title: <APPNAME>
sdk: docker
emoji: üë®‚Äçüíª
colorFrom: yellow
colorTo: green
---
\`\`\`

Important rules:
- you need to leave: "sdk: docker" as-is, but replace: "<APPNAME>" with an actual name, please.
- Don't forget to write a valid package.json file!

Remember, the app is about: ${prompt}.

Remember: don't forget to define the README.md and the package.json file!`,
